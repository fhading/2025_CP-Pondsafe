PONDSAFE: IoT-Driven Application for Predictive Rain Alerts and Water Level Monitoring for Fishpond in Barangay Vitali

📌 Project Overview

This project is an IoT-based monitoring system designed to help fishpond operators track rainfall and water levels in real-time.
The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with ultrasonic and rain sensors to collect environmental data.
Power is supplied through a solar-powered battery system for continuous operation in remote areas.

🚀 Features

Real-Time Water Level Monitoring using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
Rain Detection with predictive overflow estimation.
Solar-Powered System with TP4056 charger and MT3608 voltage booster.
Low Power Consumption for remote deployment.
Pole-Mounted Design with solar panel at the top for maximum efficiency.
Predictive Alerts


📅 Methodology

The project follows Agile methodology:
Development in iterative sprints (hardware testing, sensor calibration, predictive calculations).
Incremental improvements to system accuracy and usability.

📍 Deployment Location
The device is mounted on a pole s above the fishpond river level, ensuring sensors are safe.
The solar panel is fixed at the top of the pole for optimal sunlight exposure.
